# Dead-Horizon-game
Dead Horizon will be a Python-based, text-driven survival game that is inspired by The Oregon Trail. Players will lead a small group of survivors across a ruined city towards an evacuation site while also dealing with making tough, consequential choices that are about rationing, travel, scavenging, fortifying a base, and treating infections.

## Features
- Turn-based survival choices (travel, rest, scavenge, fortify, heal)
- Infection system
- save/load functionality
- Randomized events
  
## Software Used
- Python 3.11+
- Standard libraries: random, json, dataclass, os
- Optional: pygame for later UI expansion
