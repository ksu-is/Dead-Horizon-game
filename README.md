# Dead-Horizon_game
Dead Horizon will be a Python-based, text-driven survival game that is inspired by The Oregon Trail. Players will lead a small group of survivors across a ruined city towards an evacuation site while also dealing with making tough, consequential choices that are about rationing, travel, scavenging, fortifying a base, and treating infections.
